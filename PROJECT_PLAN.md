# Crescent Client Portal - Project Plan

## Project Overview
The Crescent Client Portal is a modern web application for staff agency clients to browse, select, and manage staff requests. The portal is built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and modern UI components.

## Objectives
- Create a seamless client experience for browsing available staff
- Implement a robust authentication and profile management system
- Develop a staff request and booking workflow
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic authentication with Supabase
- ✅ Client profile management

- ⚠️ Missing UI components (Dropdown Menu, Dialog)
- ⚠️ Issues with certain routes (hiring, profile completion)

## Technical Debt & Issues
- Missing UI components need to be installed or created
- DB schema mismatch with the existing code (client vs. clients table)
- Dependency installation issues (like @radix-ui/react-dialog)
- Port conflicts with development server

## Next Steps

  npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
  ```
- [ ] Fix component imports in files referencing missing components
- [ ] Create missing UI components (select.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx)
- [ ] Fix profile completion page errors

### Phase 2: Database Integration
- [ ] Define and document complete database schema

- [ ] Implement proper table creation migrations
- [ ] Set up proper data validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

### Phase 4: Admin Portal
- [ ] Build admin dashboard
